Dear fellow readers, greetings !!!

With this community I would like to be able to facilitate students with industry standard toolset and practices for **efficient development & deployment**, **quality product & project management** and **better productivity** to inspire **content creation** and **personal and professional management** among them.

As a student I was never inspired enough to give importance to these topics. However after a decade of struggle in the industry ...well, thank you for the opportunity.

You are always welcome to be part of our community **Finding The Dots**. Share with us how can we help you.
