Dear fellow readers, Greetings !!!

My name is Kumar and I am the creator of this community. This aims to be able to facilitate IT students with industry-standard toolset and practices for **efficient development & deployment**, **quality product & project management** and **better productivity** to inspire **content creation** and **personal and professional management** among them.

As a student, I was never inspired enough to give importance to these topics. However, after a decade of struggle in the industry, I say ... well, thank you for the opportunity.

You are always welcome to be a part of **Finding The Dots** family. Share with us how can we help you.
