## üññ Dear fellow readers, greetings !!!

With this platform I would like to be able to

#### Facilitate students with industry standard toolset and practices for
1. Efficient App Development and Deployment,
2. Quality Product and Project Management and
3. Better Productivity.

#### To inspire
1. Content creation(Code Patterns, Applications, Knowledge and Experience) and
2. Personal and professional management (self Evaluation, Realization and Correction)

among them. As a student I was never inspired enough to give importance to these topics. However after a decade of struggle in the industry, well ...thank you for the opportunity.
